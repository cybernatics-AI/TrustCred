# TrustCred: Verifiable Digital Credentials on Bitcoin

## Vision

TrustCred is a decentralized digital credential verification system built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's security. We're creating a trusted ecosystem where credentials (educational, professional, identity) can be issued, verified, and managed with complete security and transparency.

## Problem Statement

Traditional credential systems face several challenges:
- Costly and slow verification processes
- Vulnerability to forgery and fraud
- Data silos making credentials non-portable
- Lack of user control over personal credentials
- Limited transparency in credential issuance

## Solution: TrustCred

TrustCred solves these problems by:
- Enabling secure, tamper-proof credential issuance on Stacks
- Creating a transparent verification system
- Giving individuals control over their credentials
- Making credentials portable and machine-verifiable
- Reducing costs and increasing efficiency for issuers

## Key Features

- **Secure Credential Issuance**: Authorized institutions can issue tamper-proof credentials
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Recipients maintain control of their credentials
- **Selective Disclosure**: Share only the credentials you want with verifiers
- **Efficient Verification**: Instant verification without contacting the original issuer
- **Revocation Management**: Issuers can revoke credentials when necessary
- **Expiration Handling**: Automatic expiration for time-limited credentials
- **Transfer Capabilities**: Transfer credentials between wallets when needed
- **Metadata Management**: Update metadata while maintaining integrity
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all credential actions
- **Publisher Management**: Robust system for credential issuer authorization

## Technical Architecture

TrustCred is built as a modular system of Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain:

1. **Core Module** (`digital-credentials.clar`): Handles the primary data structures and core functionality
2. **Credential Operations** (`credential-operations.clar`): Manages issuance, revocation, transfers, and updates
3. **Issuer Management** (`issuer-management.clar`): Controls authorized issuers and their permissions
4. **Event Module** (`event-module.clar`): Logs all system events for transparency
5. **Utilities** (`utilities.clar`): Common utility functions used across the system

## Use Cases

### Education
- **Digital Diplomas**: Universities can issue tamper-proof diplomas
- **Certificates**: Online learning platforms can issue verified certificates
- **Transcripts**: Secure and verifiable academic records

### Professional
- **Professional Licenses**: Regulatory bodies can issue digital professional licenses
- **Certifications**: Industry associations can issue skill certifications
- **Employment Verification**: Companies can issue employment credentials

### Identity
- **ID Verification**: Government agencies can issue digital identity credentials
- **Membership**: Organizations can issue membership credentials
- **Access Control**: Enterprise access management
